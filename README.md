Using MySQL to make a mock store

This is a CLI App written in Node that functions as a mock store. 

Users can input a product name and the number of products they want to buy. 

By using a SQL database, the application keeps track of the number of products left in stock. If a user tries to buy more products than are available, they are alerted to the error and are unable to make the purchase.
